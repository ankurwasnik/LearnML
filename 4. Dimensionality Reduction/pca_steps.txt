Following are the steps for PRINCIPLE COMPONENT ANALYSIS

1. Standarized the d-dimensional data
2. Construct the covariance metrics
3. Decompose the covariance matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues
4. Sort the eigenvalues by decreasing order to rank the corresponding eigenvectors
5. Select the k eigenvectors, which correspond to the k-largest eigenvalues, where k is dimensionality of new feature subspace (k<=d)
6. Construct a projection matrix, W , from the 'top' k eigenvectors
7. Transform the d-dimensional input dataset,X using the projection matrix to obtain the new k-dimensional feature subspace.
