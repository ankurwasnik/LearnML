Find-S algorithm pseudocode

1.Initialize h to the most specific hypothesis in H
2.For each positivie training instance x :
	2.1 For each attribute constraint a , in h
		if the constraint a , is satisfied by x 
			then do nothing
		else 
			replace a, in h by next more general constraint that is satisfied by x
3.Output hypothesis h
